# C - preprocessor


In this project, I learned about the steps in compilation process of C program, `Macros`, `Pre processor directives` in C. I also learned about importance of file guards in C header files, `Standard predefined macros` of which `__FILE__`,`__DATE__`,`__LINE___` are one of them and `fuction-like macros`.

## Test: heavy_check_mark:

* [tests](./tests): Folder of test files provided by Holberton School

## Header Files :file_folder:


| Files			  |Prototypes					|
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
|`0-object_like_macro.h`  |					        |
|`1-pi.h`		  |						|
|`2-main.c`		  |						|
|`3-function_like_macro.h`|						|
|`4-sum.h`		  |						|

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Object-like Macro**
* [0-object_like_macro.h](./0-object_like_macro.h): A header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for token `1024`



* **1. Pi**
* [1-pi.h](./1-pi.h): A header file that defines a `macro` named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.

* **2.File name**
* [2-main.c](./2-main.c): A  program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.

* **3. Function-like macro**
* [3-function_like_macro.h](./3-function_like_macro.h): `function-like macro` `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`

* **4.SUM**
* [4-sum.h](./4-sum.h): `function-like macro` `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`
